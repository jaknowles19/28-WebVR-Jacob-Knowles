  <h2><b>Welcome to the Info page. Listed below are some fun facts about the Labyrinth that may shock you, they arent that crazy but they have some surprise to them.</b></h2>

  <p><b>The Labyrinth as a whole took a total of 20 hours over the course of 5 weeks to be completed.</b></p>

  <p><b>The code for each wall is mainly just copied and used for other walls as we can't be bother to type it manually, and somehow due to this a total of 8 walls around the Labyrinth are somehow flipped (not a coding bug, just a rare occurance).</b></p>

  <p><b>When first loading into the VR the only wall your able to move through is the door, this bug is unable to be fixed and it doesnt affect anything badly so we dont bother to tend to it.</b></p>

  <p><b>When the Labyrinth was in its beta version each wall id used to be very long, so if we didnt end up changing this instead of the longest id being 65 characters it could be more than triple.</b></p>

  <p><b>The earth image at the end was originally supposed to be a rotating sphere but was changed last minute, the main reason for this was because the sphere would end up stretching the image so it would not look clean</b></p>
